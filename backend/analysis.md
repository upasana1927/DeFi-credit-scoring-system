# 📊 Credit Score Analysis Report

This document presents an analysis of the credit scores assigned to wallets based on historical Aave V2 transaction data. The goal is to provide interpretability, transparency, and insight into wallet behaviors across different score ranges.

## 📌 Summary Statistics

| Metric              | Value    |
|---------------------|----------|
| **Total Wallets**   | 3,497    |
| **Average Score**   | 29       |
| **Maximum Score**   | 1000     |

Most wallet scores fall within the lower ranges, indicating a concentration of risky or inactive behavior in the data.

## 📈 Score Distribution

| Score Range   | Number of Wallets | Percentage (%) |
|---------------|--------------------|----------------|
| **0–100**     | ~3,200+            | ~91.5%         |
| **100–200**   | ~150               | ~4.3%          |
| **200–300**   | ~60                | ~1.7%          |
| **300–400**   | ~30                | ~0.8%          |
| **400–500**   | ~20                | ~0.6%          |
| **500–600**   | ~10                | ~0.3%          |
| **600–700**   | Few or None        | ~0.0%          |
| **700–800**   | Few or None        | ~0.0%          |
| **800–900**   | Few or None        | ~0.0%          |
| **900–1000**  | 1                  | ~0.03%         |

> 📌 **Conclusion**: More than **90% of wallets** scored under **100**, with only **a single wallet** achieving the maximum score of **1000**.

## 📉 Behavior of Wallets in Lower Score Range (0–100)

Wallets in this range typically exhibit:
- Very **low activity levels** (1–2 total transactions)
- Frequently **borrow** without a matching deposit
- High **liquidation risk** or history of being liquidated
- Lack of diversity in transaction types (e.g., only borrowing or redeeming)
- **Short lifespan** between first and last transaction
- Behavior suggestive of bots, one-off usage, or exploit attempts

These wallets are **deemed risky**, and their score reflects minimal or irresponsible DeFi participation.

---

## 📈 Behavior of Wallets in Higher Score Ranges (500+)

Wallets in the 500–1000 range display:
- **Balanced usage patterns** (e.g., deposit → borrow → repay)
- **Multiple transaction types**: deposit, borrow, repay, redeem, etc.
- High **repay-to-borrow ratio**
- **No liquidation events**
- Long **active duration** in protocol (weeks to months)
- Low borrow-to-deposit ratio (safer usage)

These wallets represent **responsible participants**, likely users who understand the risks and utilities of Aave V2.

## 📊 Visualization

The credit score distribution is **dynamically visualized in the frontend dashboard** using React.js and Chart.js. It shows the number of wallets falling within various score brackets, offering a real-time and interactive overview of the scoring landscape.

> 📍 *Note: The chart clearly highlights the heavy skew toward lower scores, reinforcing the need for robust risk evaluation mechanisms in DeFi protocols.*

---

## 🧩 Insights & Observations

1. **Extreme skew in the dataset**: A vast majority of wallets are inactive or exploit-prone.
2. **Data imbalance**: May require synthetic sampling or reweighting during model training in future versions.
3. **High scores are rare**: Suggests the scoring algorithm is stringent — which may be favorable for risk-sensitive DeFi protocols.
4. **Behavioral pattern clustering** could be used to further segment user types (e.g., depositors vs. borrowers).

## 📌 Next Steps

- Incorporate advanced ML models (e.g., XGBoost) for better score generalization
- Enable score re-calibration based on protocol-wide behavior norms
- Integrate with Aave’s real-time data for live scoring and alerts
